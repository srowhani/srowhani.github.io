He excels in web-development, being on top of many cutting-edge technologies and bringing a lot of valuable experience to the table. There's not many developers (let alone students) that are as in tune with the web development ecosystem as Seena. He brings a lot of innovative ideas to the table and writes code quickly and cleanly, well above expectations. He had a fantastic co-op term at Ciena working for me on a variety of challenging problems. I'd recommend anyone to take the opportunity to work with Seena, although I hope to have him back at Ciena.",
